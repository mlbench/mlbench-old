A public and reproducible collection of reference implementations and benchmark suite for distributed machine learning algorithms, frameworks and systems.

* Documentation: https://mlbench.readthedocs.io.


Features
--------

* For reproducibility and simplicity, we currently focus on standard **supervised ML**, including standard deep learning tasks as well as classic linear ML models.
* We provide **reference implementations** for each algorithm, to make it easy to port to a new framework.
* Our goal is to benchmark all/most currently relevant **distributed execution frameworks**. We welcome contributions of new frameworks in the benchmark suite.
* We provide **precisely defined tasks** and datasets to have a fair and precise comparison of all algorithms, frameworks and hardware.
* Independently of all solver implementations, we provide universal **evaluation code** allowing to compare the result metrics of different solvers and frameworks.
* Our benchmark code is easy to run on **public clouds**.
